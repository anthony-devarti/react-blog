        <p>This is where the full page for the blog posts will go so the user can view blog posts further back than the most recent 3 on the home page. It will be arranged in card format, and each card will expand to take up more of the page to view the full blog post.  Again, these blog posts will all be databased, so I want to wait until we cover django before I try to build anything significant here.  Still, this big block of text should work as a decent placeholder while I work on navigating to this page correctly.</p>
