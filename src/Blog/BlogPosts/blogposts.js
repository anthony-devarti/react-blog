            "body": "Here we are, well into the first week of bootcamp and I'd like to share a bit of my experience so far. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not? The content of week 1 definitely differed from my expectations quite a bit. This course seems like it's not only covering material that is pretty foreign to me, but also a learning and progression method that's novel to me as well. The unfamilarity with the material itself, however, is pretty in line with both my expectations and standard learning path. I generally expect to feel pretty under water for a decent chunk of time when learning a new skill, at least to the point where I move from learning to read the concepts to reading to learn the concepts.What are you excited or eager to learn more about? I'm most excited about potential applications that will provide context to the concepts themselves. For example, this assignment is giving me an opportunity to apply some of the cool markup techniques I learned in my first few days. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? I absolutely love board games. You've got the whole package, here. Boardgamegeek account, matching binders for rule books, coin capsules, plano tackle boxes, 30 different sizes of sleeves for every component. Seriously, it borders on compulsive behavior😰. I especially love cooperative, narrative-driven games like Nemesis, Arkham Files Games (pick any of them, really), and Zona. Here's part of the game shelf where I keep most of my favorites:",

            "body": "What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish? Something I would like to be able to do is to make a simple, web-based tool or application that would serve some sort of function. Something small like a dice roller web page. I find small side projects like this provide a consequence free canvas for me to experiment and test new techniques or lessons on, and would likely grow more complicated over time.  What are you struggling with? One struggle that I keep finding myself running into seems to be surrounding vocabulary. When I come across a word or concept that I don't recognize, I look up that word, which often leads down a rabbit hole of more content that is new to me. This can cause reading documentation or descriptions to become very involved, very quickly, as each term can lead to an exponentially increasing amount of content to consume, where one new term leads to three, which each lead to three new terms, each of which lead to three new terms. . It's all very interesting, but I have looked at the clock after getting 4 layers deep and realize that I have spent an hour on a single sentence!   How do you solve a problem? I read. A lot. If I run into an issue, I find a resource (skill growth has and will continue to help me to recognize and find good, reliable resources more quickly), and dive in. After reading, I dive in and start experimenting to try to apply the reading.  What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? If I find myself stuck, I try to give myself another task to work on. I like to keep a running to-do list at all times, and if I can't complete one task, I will try to get it to a stable, fresh starting point, then move onto something else. When I come back, I can try to apply \"fresh eyes\" to the problem and that can help me look at it from another angle. I also try to think of other places I have seen this successfully implemented, and look to see how it was addressed there. If I look at a few places and find that multiple are solving the problem the same way, I do a deep dive in reading about that solution, to see if I can understand why it was used, how it works, and if that solution is applicable to my situation.",

        //     "body": "We covered a lot of concepts during the second week of in-person learning. We really focused on API calls and how to get outside data into your code. This really provided a lot of real-world application opportunities for some of the building block concepts that we had already covered. We got even more practice using the concepts from last week and applying them to new materail. What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process? The importance of being able to pull in data from other sources can't be overstated. Once you are able to build on top of existing, known-good, code and information, the ability to build increasingly complex tools and pages expands massively. What does it mean to develop good code? Good code is code that is readable by others, scalable, so you can grow and expand it later, and gets you from point a to point b in as few lines of code as your current skill level allows. That last point is one that I want to explain in a bit more detail. Put simply, what was \"good code\" for me a week ago, is not the same as what \"good code\" would look like for me today. Today's \"good\" won't look \"good\" next week, and that week's \"good\" won't look \"good\" the week after that. As long as my skill level is growing, past projects should look worse and worse as time goes on. That just gives more opporunities for refactoring.  What does it mean to be a good developer? A good developer is one that is never content with their current skill level. The subject matter is too big, too frequently updating, and real-world applications too nebulous to ever execute truly perfectly. That means that there is always something to refactor, always something to improve, and always something new to learn. Being willing to exist in that state of constant growth makes for a good developer. Any given project may be \"good enough\" to ship, once it meets the requirements of it, but the developer who wrote it should never be \"good enough\" to close themselves off to new concepts, techniques, or methods.  What is one thing that programmers hate doing? Repeating themselves, repeating themselves, repeating themselves. (I'm immune to this because I'm not quite there, yet) Repeating yourself in code doesn't just mean that you have to type more on the first time around, but what happens when you want to adjust a line of code later? If you've repeated that code 4 times, that means that you have to apply that fix 4 times. If your update doesn't work as expected, and you want to adjust, you have to do that same adjustment 4 times. Repetition makes your code less readable, harder to refactor, and take longer to produce.",

        //     "body": "Fiction writers can almost always be divided into two main camps.  They’re often referred to as “plotters” or “pantsers.”  “Pantsers” are called such because, in the most respectful interpretation, they “fly by the seat of their pants.”  Your pantser author will often find themselves surprised by the actions and reactions of their own characters, or even the world as a whole.  Plotters, on the other hand, are called such because they will plot, diagram, outline, define, and research thoroughly.  Usually long before the first bit of prose hits the page. Failing to pre-plan any work will, at best, save a few minutes.  At worst, it will devolve quickly into a series of repetitive corrections that manage to still leave errors on the screen. Pseudocoding, much like plot diagrams, serve an irreplaceably important function in the design  and implementation of a project.  If the end user’s experience is the top priority, as it should be, then starting from a top-down perspective allows the creator to construct the entire work around that user, rather than the creator. Pseudocode allows you to have all of your pieces defined and ready before you write your first line of code, meaning that your “characters” are far less likely to surprise you, later.  Disorganization can be disastrous at any step in any project.  The law of conservation of detail[citation] dictates that no detail should be introduced that is not made relevant later.  Declared and unused variables, identical functions with different names, or elements that appear out of order are all signs of lacking pseudocode. Function chekovsGun ( ){    if (act1.includes(firearm) && !act2.includes(firearm)){                    return badWriting                }            }               Object-Oriented-Programming[citation] demands an even higher level of pseudocoding than functional programming.  Moving pieces, instantiations of previous classes, and a separation of concerns mean things can get very muddy for the pantsers among us very quickly.  Defined, clear objects are like well-written characters.  They have enough information to do everything they need to do, but do not take up more space than they must.  This is nearly possible to achieve if you are simply writing code as you go.  It’s far more likely that a bit of a class’ constructor ends up outside of the constructor block, two methods that could easily be generalized into one, or even that there is a definition of a variable that is defined and forgotten.  Repeated corrections to fix these errors can often have unintended consequences.  If the developer simply moves through, and finds himself surprised by what is needed to accomplish the current goal, then they may end up doing twice as much typing as one who had planned things out and, after all of that extra work, what they are likely to be left with is code that is more verbose, less readable, and less orthogonal than the well-plotted code would likely have been.            Plot development, like code, is very possible to do without a large amount of prior planning and preparatory work.  This approach usually requires a strong mastery of all of the concepts and skills necessary, and will likely take far longer than with a detailed map in hand.  I’m certainly new to coding, but if I were to compare it to something that I have spent far more time with, then I suspect that anyone with enough skill to skip pseudocoding entirely will probably have enough sense not to do so.  For the sake of clarity, I have attached my “pseudocode” for this blog post/ technical article below.
